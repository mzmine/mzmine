 * This interface is used to provide a dataset with x and y values. The amount of x and y values has
 * to be equal and is checked via the {@link List#size()} method.
 * <p></p>
 * The values are not grabbed during the creation of the dataset. After initialising the dataset
 * (e.g. {@link ColoredXYDataset}) a thread is started where the values of the dataset can be
 * calculated or loaded from disk. For that operation, the
 * {@link XYValueProvider#computeValues(Property)} method is used. The implementing class can supply
 * information on the progress of the operation via the method
 * {@link XYValueProvider#getComputationFinishedPercentage()}, which will be represented in the task
 * bar.
 * <p></p>
 * When the computation ({@link XYValueProvider#computeValues} has finished, the values are loaded
 * into the dataset via the {@link XYValueProvider#getDomainValue(int)} and
 * {@link XYValueProvider#getRangeValue(int)} methods.
 * <p></p>
 * After the dataset has been loaded successfully, the chart is automatically updated via a
 * {@link org.jfree.chart.JFreeChart#fireChartChanged()} event.
