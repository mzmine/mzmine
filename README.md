## License

mzmine source codes are distributed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).


## Releases

[Releases](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/releases?q=&expanded=true) are split into [stable releases](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/releases/latest)
and
the [latest development build](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/releases/tag/Development-release)
which reflects the current state of the master branch and is meant for testing purposes. Download
options include portable versions and installers for the Window, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

mzmine should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux using either the installers or the portable versions. There are **NO** further requirements as mzmine packages a specific Java Virtual Machine. This means the local Java installation has **no** impact on mzmine. Windows users might be warned that mzmine is not signed or from a trusted source and have to click run anyways. 

Before creating your first project, we recommend to [set the preferences](#set-user-preferences).

### Installation on Linux
