<h1>Duplicate filter</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Two peaks are considered duplicates when their m/z and retention time differences are lower than
the tolerances set by the user. When two (or more) duplicates are found, a consensus row is created with the lowest row ID of all duplicates. For this consensus 
row, all <span style="background-color: #00FF00"><b>DETECTED</b></span> features are favored over <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>ESTIMATED</b></span> (gap-filled) and ESTIMATED are favored over <span style="background-color: #FF0000"><b>UNKNOWN</b></span>. 
Furthermore, if there are only <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>ESTIMATED</b></span> features in a raw data file, the highest is chosen.
</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
This filter might be very helpful to eliminate misaligned feature list rows after the gap-filling process. 
As the average retention time and m/z value for two duplicates should be very close after gap-filling. A more restrictive option is to mark all rows as duplicates that share one duplicate feature. 
To use this filter, turn off the average option.


<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Name sufix</dt>
<dd>This is the suffix to identify the new aligned peak list in Peak list frame of desktop.</dd>

<dt>Filter average m/z and RT</dt>
<dd>If checked:	Compares rows with the average m/z and RT (like the old algorithm)</dd>
<dd>If not:		Compares rows on a raw data file basis. Marks rows as duplicates if two rows share a feature in a raw data file with the same RT and m/z (and identity/charge state)</dd>

<dt>M/Z tolerance</dt>
<dd>Maximum m/z difference between duplicate peaks.</dd>

<dt>RT tolerance</dt>
<dd>Maximum retention time difference between duplicate peaks.</dd>

<dt>Require same identification</dt>
<dd>If the checkbox is selected duplicate peaks must have the same identification.</dd>

<dt>Remove source peak list after fitering</dt>
<dd>It the checkbox is selected the source peak list will be remove and the filtered version remains.</dd>
