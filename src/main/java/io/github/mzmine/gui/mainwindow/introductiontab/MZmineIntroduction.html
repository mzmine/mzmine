<h2>Getting started</h2>
<b>1. Set preferences</b><br>
  Before starting data processing you can configure MZmine 3 according to your
  preferences. Go to <b>Project</b> / <b>Set preferences</b> to set the value formats, color
  palette, chart parameters, and other settings. <b>We recommend setting a temporary file folder to
  an SSD drive with enough space.</b> Go to <i>Project</i> / <i>Set preferences</i> /
  <i>Temporary file directory</i>. (Requires a restart to take effect)

<p>
<b>2. Batch wizard - Easy workflow setup</b><br>
  The processing wizard (found in the main menu) facilitates setting up a basic LC-MS or LC-IMS-MS
  data processing workflow. The major steps including data import, spectral processing, and feature
  finding are set up based on a few parameters leading to an optional export to feature-based
  molecular networking (<b>FBMN</b>) or Ion Identity Molecular Networking (<b>IIMN</b>) on <b>GNPS</b> and
  compound annotation by <b>SIRIUS</b>. <br>
  <b>Important:</b> The wizard does <b>not</b> replace optimization of feature finding. Refer to the
  <a href="https://mzmine.github.io/mzmine_documentation/">MZmine docs</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Import your data</b><br>
  MZmine 3 can read and process both low-resolution (unit mass) and high-resolution (exact mass)
  data in both continuous (profile) and centroided modes, including fragmentation (MS<sup>n</sup>)
  data, ion mobility data, and MS imaging data. To see the complete list of supported file formats
  and to import your data go to <b>Raw data methods</b> / <b>Raw data import</b>. Double-click the
  imported file to see an overview of the raw data.
</p>

<p>
<b>4. Process and visualize the data</b><br>
  MZmine 3 provides many modules for MS data processing and visualization, which can be found in
  the main menu. The typical workflow consists of subsequent application of <b>Raw data methods</b>
  on the imported files, <b>Feature detection</b> (producing new <b>feature lists</b>), and
  <b>Feature list methods</b>. Use the <b>Visualization</b> modules to explore the results. If
  you have a trouble with any module click on the <b>Help</b> button in the corresponding parameter
  setup dialog. More information, tutorials, and videos are available at the MZmine website.
