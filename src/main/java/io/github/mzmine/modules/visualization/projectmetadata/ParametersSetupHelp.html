<h1>Project Parameter Setup</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This module sets up parameters for current project. User can add, import, edit and remove parameters.
    The table view present at the center allows for editing parameters values for any raw data file. Various options and their features are listed -
    <ol>
        <li>Add New Parameter -
            <br/> Provides option to add new parameter to project. User needs to provide unique parameter name and can provide description for the parameter too.
        </li>
        <li>Import Parameter and Values -
            <br/> User can import parameter from a csv file. The structure of file should be in following way -
                <br/>First column of the comma-separated file must contain file names matching to names of raw data files opened in MZmine.
    Each other column corresponds to one project parameter. First row in the file must contain column headers. Header for the first column (filename) is ignored but must exists.
    Rest of the column headers are used as names for project parameters. All column names in the file must be be unique.
    If main dialog already contains a parameter with the same name, a warning is shown to the user before overwriting previous parameter.
    All the column headers must have unique name. All parameters are considered String type for simplicity.
        </li>
        <li>Remove selected parameter -
            <br/> This option will remove the parameter corresponding to the current selected cell.
            The first column (Raw data file name) cannot be removed from the project.
        </li>

    </ol>
