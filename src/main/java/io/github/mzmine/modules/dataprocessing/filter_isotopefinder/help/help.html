<h1>Isotope finder</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  This module searches for possible isotope signals in MS1 data in the FWHM of all features.
  Compared to the isotope filter (useful to remove isotope features from the feature list),
  this module aims to provide a complete set of possible isotope signals with they mean relative
  height across multiple scans. However, not all signals will be isotope signals.
</p>

<p>
  The most appropriate place to apply this module might be after feature deconvolution and
  deisotoping (if applied).
