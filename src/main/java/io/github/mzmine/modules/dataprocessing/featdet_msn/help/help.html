        <h1>MSn feature list builder</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The MSn feature list builder detects MS1 precursor signals which possess an MSn scan.
            The modules scans the raw data looking for MSn scans and builds a
            chromatographic feature for each MS1 precursor ion with a corresponding MSn scan.
        </p><p>
            The feature list of precursor signals is constructed using the specified mass and
            retention time tolerances. For each detected MSn-containing precursor signal, a targeted chromatogram
            in the retention time range is built using all MS1 basepeaks within the mass range. 
        </p><p>
            If more than one peak is detected in the range or more precise peak integration
            is required, the feature list may be deconvoluted via the <b>Chromatogram Deconvolution</b> tool.
        </p>

        <h4>Method parameters</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>MS level</dt>
            <dd>The MS level for precursor feature building. All fragment scans corresponding to this MS level
                are detected and traced back to their MS1 precursor ion origin. <i>Do not set MS Level in the
                Scan Selection field - this will cause the algorithm to behave improperly.</i></dd>
            <dt>m/z Tolerance</dt>
            <dd>Precursor ion (MS1) mass tolerance for feature building. All MS1 base peaks within this mass range will be
            use to build a targeted chromatogram feature.</dd>
            <dt>Retention time tolerance</dt>
            <dd>Precursor ion (MS1) retention time tolerance for feature building. All MS1 base peaks with this retention time range
            will be used to build a targeted chromatogram feature.</dd>
