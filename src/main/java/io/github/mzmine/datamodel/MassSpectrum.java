 * Iterable, but there is an important point - to avoid consuming memory for each DataPoint
 * instance, we will iterate over the stored data points with a single DataPoint instance that is
 * incrementing an internal cursor. That means this code will work:
 * <p>
 * {@code for (DataPoint d : spectrum) System.out.println(d.getMz() + ":" + d.getIntensity();} but
 * this code will NOT work:
 * {@code ArrayList<DataPoint> list = new ArrayList<>(); list.addAll(spectrum);}
